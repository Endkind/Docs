## Notes on `retype.yml` and the Exclude List

In the `retype.yml` file, you will find an `exclude` section listing files ignored by Retype. These files should not be 100% excluded, as they may serve as templates for scripts or as examples for future entries.

**Recommendation:**
- Check if the excluded files are relevant for your PR (e.g., as templates or for scripts).
- If you propose changes to these files, explain in your PR why they are important despite being excluded.
- Document in your PR how the file is used or why it should not be ignored.
